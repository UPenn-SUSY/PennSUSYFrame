Workflow:

1) First run over all the D3PDs:
TODO write documentation for this

2) Generate Histogram files for each sample:
    - Each MC sample should be kept separate in order to properly do lumi
      weighting
    - Move to HistMaker directory
    - Run HistMaker program using a config file:
      - ./HistMaker run/CreateHistograms/test_data.config

3) Merge histograms into Data/MC comparison plots:
    - Move to HistHandle directory
    - Call parse.py on a yml config file:
      - python parse.py ../HistMaker/run/PlotHistograms/test_compare_config.yml 
    - TODO make this a little less awkward in terms of jumping around between
      directories

4) Run Optimization:
    -
